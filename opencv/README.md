## OpenCV

These are some of the basic implementations of OpenCV which I learned during my 1st year. Please don't refer to it because there are many faults in these codes. I  uploaded it here so that I can feel embarrassed about myself regarding my past. Which I think will hopefully help me to work well in the upcoming future.
